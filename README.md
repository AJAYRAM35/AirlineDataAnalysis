Description:
## This project leverages synthetic airline data to extract valuable insights using Qlik, a
business intelligence and data visualization tool. The data simulates various aspects
of airline operations, including flight schedules, passenger demographics, ticket
sales, and performance metrics. The objective is to use Qlik's capabilities to identify
patterns, trends, and correlations within the data, aiding decision-making for airlines,
airports, and related stakeholders.
